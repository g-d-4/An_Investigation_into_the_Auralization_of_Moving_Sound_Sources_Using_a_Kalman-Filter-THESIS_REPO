# An_Investigation_into_the_Auralization_of_Moving_Sound_Sources_Using_a_Kalman-Filter-THESIS_REPO
Hello! Welcome to the Git repository of our Master thesis. Here you may find the necessary code implementations for the procedures and results found in our thesis. Happy reading and testing! - Borys &amp; Gautam

The code can be split into 2 parts: 2 .py files containing functions that are called in other py files. The funtion of each file can be found below:

kalman_filter.py -> Contains 2 funtions, one to implement a single iteration of the Kalman filter implementation described in our thesis, and one to run the Kalman filter across the length of the measurement signal
